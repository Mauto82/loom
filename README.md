# Loom

> A folder of files + an LLM as your knowledge base.

Loom is a small desktop app and CLI built around one idea: **the files in a folder are the truth**. You drop markdown, PDF, HTML and text files into a directory of your choice. Loom scans it, asks an LLM to write a summary and a handful of keywords for each file, and stores those next to a full-text index in SQLite. When you ask a question, Loom does ONE LLM call: it picks the most relevant files with BM25 and hands them to the model.

No embeddings. No vector DB. No chunking. No graph. No fancy reranking.

This is a deliberate revival of [Andrej Karpathy's "LLM Wiki" pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f), with one concession: a tiny SQLite index so search stays snappy as the folder grows past `grep`-friendly size.

## How it works

```
~/loom/                          ← your folder, your files, your editor
├── ricette.md
├── papers/
│   └── llm-wiki.pdf
├── articolo.html
└── note-libere.md

~/.loom/
├── config.toml                  ← provider + model + folder paths
└── index.db                     ← SQLite (regenerable from the folder)
```

**Scan** — for every new or modified file, Loom extracts text (via `ledongthuc/pdf`, `go-readability`, or plain read), then asks the LLM:
> "Riassumi in 150-250 parole + estrai 5-8 keywords come JSON."

The summary, keywords, content, hash and mtime go into one SQLite row plus an FTS5 mirror.

**Ask** — Loom runs an FTS5 BM25 search over `title + summary + keywords + content`, takes the top 5 hits, and hands their summaries + (truncated) content to the LLM with a system prompt that says "rispondi solo usando queste note, cita con `[rel_path]`". One call. The answer streams back.

That's it.

## Install

**macOS (Homebrew) — easiest:**

```bash
brew tap Mauto82/loom
brew install loom
```

This installs both `loom` (CLI) and `loom-mcp` (MCP server). The desktop GUI (`Loom.app`) is available as a separate download on the [releases page](https://github.com/Mauto82/loom/releases).

**From source** — requires Go 1.26+ and (for the GUI) Node 20+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mauto82/loom.git
cd loom
go install ./cmd/loom ./cmd/loom-mcp

# GUI
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
cd cmd/loom-gui && wails build
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Initialise: writes ~/.loom/config.toml and creates ~/loom/.
loom init

# 2. Drop files into ~/loom/. Markdown, PDF, HTML, TXT.

# 3. Scan: extracts text, summarises each new/changed file via the LLM.
loom scan

# 4. Ask:
loom ask "cosa ho scritto sul progetto X?"
```

## Configuration

`~/.loom/config.toml`:

```toml
notes_dir = "~/loom"
db_path   = "~/.loom/index.db"

[llm]
provider    = "ollama"           # "ollama" | "openai" | "anthropic"
model       = "llama3.1:8b"
endpoint    = "http://localhost:11434"
api_key_env = ""                 # e.g. "OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Cloud providers:

```toml
[llm]
provider    = "anthropic"
model       = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
api_key_env = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

Loom never stores the API key on disk — only the env var name.

## Organising your folder

Loom walks the notes folder recursively, so subdirectories work out of the box:

```
~/loom/
├── work/
│   ├── project-x.md
│   └── meetings.md
├── recipes/
│   └── carbonara.md
└── papers/
    └── llm-wiki.pdf
```

Citations in answers reflect the full relative path: `[work/project-x.md]`.

**Moving or renaming files** is handled efficiently: Loom detects that the content hash matches an existing record and reuses the summary and keywords without an extra LLM call. The old path is removed from the index automatically.

Hidden directories (names starting with `.`, e.g. `.git`, `.obsidian`) are always skipped.

## PDFs

PDFs are best-effort:

1. Pure-Go text extraction first (`ledongthuc/pdf`).
2. If a page comes out empty AND `pdftoppm` + `tesseract` are on PATH, OCR fills the gaps.
3. If both fail, the file is still indexed with a placeholder summary; the LLM just won't quote it.

To install OCR tools:

```bash
# macOS
brew install poppler tesseract tesseract-lang

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-ita
```

Want a non-English language? Set `TESSERACT_LANGS` in your shell:

```bash
export TESSERACT_LANGS="eng+ita"
```

## Use Loom as memory for Claude Code / Claude Desktop

`loom-mcp` is a stdio MCP server that exposes the indexed folder to any MCP-aware client. Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loom": {
      "command": "loom-mcp",
      "args": ["--config", "/Users/you/.loom/config.toml"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask Claude things like *"check loom for what I wrote about postgres tuning"* — it'll call `loom.ask` and ground its answer in your notes.

Tools exposed:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `loom.ask(question, top_k?)` | One-shot answer with file citations (1 LLM call) |
| `loom.search(query, limit?)` | Raw BM25 hits, no LLM call |
| `loom.scan(force?)` | (Re)index the notes folder |
| `loom.list_files()` | Browse every indexed file with summary + keywords |
| `loom.get_file(rel_path)` | Fetch full extracted content of one file |

## GUI

`Loom.app` is a Wails desktop app with two panels: the file list on the left, the chat on the right. Click a file to open a read-only viewer with markdown rendering. Click a citation pill `[file.md]` in an answer to jump to that file. The settings cog opens a single modal — provider, model, endpoint, API-key env var, folder paths. That's all.

```bash
cd cmd/loom-gui && wails dev    # hot-reload during development
cd cmd/loom-gui && wails build  # release binary
```

## Repository layout

```
cmd/
  loom/        CLI: init / scan / ask

  llm/         Ollama / OpenAI / Anthropic adapters
  query/       BM25 search → 1 LLM call → answer + citations
  storage/     SQLite (one `files` table + FTS5 mirror)
```

## Development

```bash
go test ./...                    # all tests
go vet ./...

# Smoke test against a real Ollama:
mkdir -p /tmp/loomtest
echo "# Carbonara\nGuanciale, pecorino, uova." > /tmp/loomtest/ricetta.md
echo 'notes_dir = "/tmp/loomtest"
db_path = "/tmp/loomtest.db"
[llm]
provider = "ollama"
model    = "llama3.1:8b"' > /tmp/loomtest.toml

go run ./cmd/loom --config /tmp/loomtest.toml scan
go run ./cmd/loom --config /tmp/loomtest.toml ask "cosa serve per la carbonara?"
```

## Status

**v0.4** — radical rewrite from a 4-LLM-call RAG pipeline back to the original Karpathy-flavoured idea. Three binaries (`loom`, `loom-mcp`, `Loom.app`), one SQLite table.
