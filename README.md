# Loom

> A folder of files + an LLM as your knowledge base.

Loom is a small desktop app and CLI built around one idea: **the files in a folder are the truth**. You drop markdown, PDF, HTML and text files into a directory of your choice. Loom scans it, asks an LLM to write a summary and a handful of keywords for each file, and stores those next to a full-text index in SQLite. When you ask a question, Loom does ONE LLM call: it picks the most relevant files with BM25 and hands them to the model.

No embeddings. No vector DB. No chunking. No graph. No fancy reranking.

This is a deliberate revival of [Andrej Karpathy's "LLM Wiki" pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f), with one concession: a tiny SQLite index so search stays snappy as the folder grows past `grep`-friendly size.

## How it works

```
~/loom/                          ← your folder, your files, your editor
├── ricette.md
├── papers/
│   └── llm-wiki.pdf
├── articolo.html
└── note-libere.md

# or point Loom at folders that already exist on your machine:
# notes_dirs = ["/Users/you/Documents/work", "/Users/you/Obsidian/vault"]

~/.loom/
├── config.toml                  ← provider + model + folder paths
└── index.db                     ← SQLite (regenerable from the folder)
```

**Scan** — for every new or modified file, Loom extracts text (via `ledongthuc/pdf`, `go-readability`, plain read, or a vision OCR model for images), then asks the LLM:
> "Riassumi in 150-250 parole + estrai 5-8 keywords come JSON."

The summary, keywords, content, hash and mtime go into one SQLite row plus an FTS5 mirror.

**Ask** — Loom runs an FTS5 BM25 search over `title + summary + keywords + content`, takes the top 5 hits, and hands their summaries + (truncated) content to the LLM with a system prompt that says "rispondi solo usando queste note, cita con `[rel_path]`". One call. The answer streams back.

That's it.

## Install

**macOS (Homebrew) — easiest:**

```bash
brew tap Mauto82/loom
brew install loom
```

This installs both `loom` (CLI) and `loom-mcp` (MCP server). The desktop GUI (`Loom.app`) is available as a separate download on the [releases page](https://github.com/Mauto82/loom/releases).

**From source** — requires Go 1.26+ and (for the GUI) Node 20+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mauto82/loom.git
cd loom
go install ./cmd/loom ./cmd/loom-mcp

# Optional: HTTP server (for integrating Loom into other apps/services)
go install ./cmd/loom-http

# GUI
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
cd cmd/loom-gui && wails build
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Initialise: writes ~/.loom/config.toml and creates ~/loom/.
loom init

# 2. Drop files into ~/loom/. Markdown, PDF, HTML, TXT.

# 3. Scan: extracts text, summarises each new/changed file via the LLM.
loom scan

# 4. Ask:
loom ask "cosa ho scritto sul progetto X?"
```

## Configuration

`~/.loom/config.toml` is created by `loom init` with all three provider options as ready-to-use commented blocks.

| Provider | `provider` | Model example | `api_key_env` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ollama (local) | `ollama` | `llama3.1:8b` | — |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-4-5` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `gpt-4o` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

> **`api_key_env` is the name of an environment variable**, not the key itself — the key is never written to disk. Set it in your shell before running Loom:
> ```bash
> export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
> ```

To switch provider, open `~/.loom/config.toml`, uncomment the block you want and comment out the others:

```toml
# Ollama (local, default)
[llm]
provider    = "ollama"
model       = "llama3.1:8b"
endpoint    = "http://localhost:11434"
api_key_env = ""

# Anthropic Claude
# [llm]
# provider    = "anthropic"
# model       = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
# api_key_env = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"

# OpenAI
# [llm]
# provider    = "openai"
# model       = "gpt-4o"
# api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

The `endpoint` field is optional for cloud providers (defaults are built in). For Ollama it defaults to `http://localhost:11434`.

## Organising your notes

### Single folder

Loom walks the notes folder recursively, so subdirectories work out of the box:

```
~/loom/
├── work/
│   ├── project-x.md
│   └── meetings.md
├── recipes/
│   └── carbonara.md
└── papers/
    └── llm-wiki.pdf
```

Citations in answers reflect the full relative path: `[work/project-x.md]`.

### Multiple folders — no need to move files

You can point Loom at as many folders as you like. No need to copy or move anything:

```toml
notes_dirs = [
  "/Users/you/Documents/work",
  "/Users/you/Obsidian/vault",
  "/Users/you/Desktop/papers",
]
```

When more than one folder is configured, Loom prefixes each relative path with the folder's name to keep them unambiguous:

```
work/meeting-notes.md
vault/zettelkasten.md
papers/llm-wiki.pdf
```

Citations in answers carry this prefix too: `[work/meeting-notes.md]`.

**Backward compatibility** — old configs that use `notes_dir = "..."` (singular) are migrated automatically; no changes needed.

### Moving or renaming files

Loom detects that the content hash matches an existing record and reuses the summary and keywords without an extra LLM call. The old path is removed from the index automatically.

Hidden directories (names starting with `.`, e.g. `.git`, `.obsidian`) are always skipped.

## PDFs and images

### Text-based PDFs

Pure-Go extraction (`ledongthuc/pdf`) — no dependencies, always runs.

### Scanned PDFs and image files (OCR)

Two OCR backends are available, both optional:

**Option A — GLM-OCR via Ollama (recommended)**: a local vision model that outputs structured markdown (preserves headings, tables, lists).

```bash
ollama pull glm-ocr
```

Then add one line to `~/.loom/config.toml`:

```toml
[llm]
provider  = "ollama"
model     = "gemma4:31b"   # your chat model
endpoint  = "http://localhost:11434"
ocr_model = "glm-ocr"      # vision model for OCR — leave empty to disable
```

When `ocr_model` is set, Loom also indexes **image files** directly (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, TIFF). Drop a screenshot or a scanned page into your notes folder and it will be transcribed and searchable like any other file.

**Option B — Tesseract** (fallback when `ocr_model` is not set):

```bash
# macOS
brew install poppler tesseract tesseract-lang

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-ita
```

Override the OCR language:

```bash
export TESSERACT_LANGS="eng+ita"
```

### Fallback behaviour

If all OCR options fail, the file is still indexed with a placeholder summary; the LLM won't quote it but the user sees it in the list.

## Use Loom as memory for Claude Code / Claude Desktop

`loom-mcp` is a stdio MCP server that exposes the indexed folder to any MCP-aware client. Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loom": {
      "command": "loom-mcp",
      "args": ["--config", "/Users/you/.loom/config.toml"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask Claude things like *"check loom for what I wrote about postgres tuning"* — it'll call `loom.ask` and ground its answer in your notes.

Tools exposed:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `loom.ask(question, top_k?)` | One-shot answer with file citations (1 LLM call) |
| `loom.search(query, limit?)` | Raw BM25 hits, no LLM call |
| `loom.scan(force?)` | (Re)index the notes folder |
| `loom.list_files()` | Browse every indexed file with summary + keywords |
| `loom.get_file(rel_path)` | Fetch full extracted content of one file |

## Use Loom over HTTP (optional)

Loom is local-first: the CLI, MCP and GUI all run against a folder on your machine and need no server. But if you want **another application** (a backend, a microservice, anything that isn't MCP-aware) to query your knowledge base, `loom-http` exposes the same index over a tiny REST API. It's entirely optional — Loom works without it.

```bash
LOOM_HTTP_ADDR=:8080 loom-http --config ~/.loom/config.toml
```

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness check |
| `POST /search {query, limit?}` | Raw BM25 hits (`rel_path,title,summary,content,rank`) — **no LLM call** |
| `POST /scan {force?}` | (Re)index the notes folder (uses the LLM to summarise) |

`/search` is the natural fit for "retrieve, then let *my* model answer": your app gets the most relevant files and composes the reply with its own prompt. Example:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/search -d '{"query":"check-in time","limit":3}'
```

## GUI

`Loom.app` is a Wails desktop app with two panels: the file list on the left, the chat on the right. Click a file to open a read-only viewer with markdown rendering. Click a citation pill `[file.md]` in an answer to jump to that file. The settings cog opens a single modal — provider, model, endpoint, API-key env var, folder paths. That's all.

```bash
cd cmd/loom-gui && wails dev    # hot-reload during development
cd cmd/loom-gui && wails build  # release binary
```

## Status

**v0.4** — radical rewrite from a 4-LLM-call RAG pipeline back to the original Karpathy-flavoured idea. Three binaries (`loom`, `loom-mcp`, `Loom.app`), one SQLite table.
