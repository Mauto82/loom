# Changelog

All notable changes to Loom are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`loom-http`** — an optional REST server (`cmd/loom-http`) that exposes the
  Loom index over HTTP for applications that aren't MCP-aware (e.g. a backend or
  microservice that wants to use Loom as a retrieval layer):
  - `GET /healthz` — liveness check.
  - `POST /search {query, limit?}` — raw BM25 hits (`rel_path, title, summary,
    content, rank`), **no LLM call**. Ideal for "retrieve here, answer in your
    own model".
  - `POST /scan {force?}` — (re)index the notes folder.
  It reuses the same `config.toml` as `loom` and `loom-mcp` (`--config` /
  `LOOM_CONFIG`); listen address via `LOOM_HTTP_ADDR` (default `:8080`).

### Notes
- The HTTP server is **additive and optional**. It does not change Loom's core
  idea — a folder of files on your machine as the source of truth, queried
  locally with no embeddings and no vector DB.

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- Support for multiple notes directories via `notes_dirs` (point Loom at folders
  that already exist on your machine; the legacy singular `notes_dir` is migrated
  automatically).

## [0.3.1] - [0.3.0]

- Earlier releases. See the Git history and the
  [releases page](https://github.com/Mauto82/loom/releases) for details.
